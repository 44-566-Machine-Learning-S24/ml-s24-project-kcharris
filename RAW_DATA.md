## Raw Data
[readme](README.md)  

I started with an interest in movies. Searching for datasets for movies led to a few. The one I ended up choosing was found on Kaggle. I would have prefered to not use Kaggle for the dataset, but the datasets metadata and number of entries sounded useful and interesting.
