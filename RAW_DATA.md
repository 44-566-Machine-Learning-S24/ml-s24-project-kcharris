## Raw Data
I started with an interest in movies. Searching for datasets for movies led to a few. The one I ended up choosing was found on Kaggle. I would have prefered to not use Kaggle for the dataset, but the datasets metadata and number of entries sounded useful and interesting.

The specific file chosen from the zip is movies_metadata.csv
