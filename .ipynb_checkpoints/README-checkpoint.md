# 44-566 machine-learning project
Repo for all project documents

#### Early project update, change in dataset:
The original data or idea for the project was to use a US dataset that contained data on health to see if there is any relation between different diseases and being overweight. Due to the complexity of the dataset, a lack of interest in the dataset, and a lack of numerical values in the dataset I could use for analysis I've decided to move to a Movie metadata dataset sourced or shared to me from Kaggle.
This new dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset/data?select=movies_metadata.csv
